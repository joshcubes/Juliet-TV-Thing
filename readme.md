# Juliet Visualizer

**Juliet Visualizer** is a web-based audio visualizer and backdrop application for the band [Juliet](https://instagram.com/theband.juliet). It features a bouncing logo reminiscent of a DVD screensaver and a real-time waveform visualization of the guitar signal. The interactive settings menu gives you full control over each element.

## Features

- **Settings Menu**
  Press 'S' or click in the top-left corner to open the settings menu. 

- **Bouncing Logo**  
  The logo bounces around like the old dvd logo thing. 
  - Use the *Enable Logo* toggle to turn the logo on or off
  - Adjust the *Logo Size* to change its size (as a percentage of the window height)
  - Use the *Logo Speed* slider to set its movement speed. 
  - You can also upload a custom logo though this is only local and it will default back to Juliet's every refresh.

- **Waveform Visualization**  
  The visualizer displays a real-time waveform of the guitar input from your default microphone. You can:
  - Toggle the waveform display with the *Enable Waveform* checkbox.
  - Change the *Waveform Color* using the color picker.
  - Adjust the *Waveform Zoom* to zoom into wave.
  - Modify the *Analyser Gain* slider to adjust audio sensitivity.
  - Set the *Line Thickness* to control the width of the waveform line.
  - Tweak the *Waveform Smoothing* level to smooth out the waveform's appearance.

- **Save & Load Settings**  
  Save your custom configuration as a JSON file, load a saved configuration, or reset everything to default using the corresponding buttons in the settings menu.
